    "text": "Husband & Father | Data Analyst | Welfare Economist | Community Services | Co- Founder of Itsy Websy Technology\nI believe that data can help take us a long way in making better decisions. I‚Äôm passionate about evidence-based decision making and the practical use of it. My areas of interest lie in the practical application of Welfare and Social Economics- the study of the relationship between resource allocation in society and social well-being.\nMy journey with data first started when I studied Economics at University. I later graduated with a Bachelor of Economics (Honours), with majors in Economics, Management and Human Resource Management. My honours journey introduced the art and science of data analytics with my own research project. I found that I excelled in quantitative research and analysis. During that year, I also achieved top grades in HR Analytics, which pulled on a number of Economics concepts at the organisational level.\nAs a result of my Honours research, I was hired as a research assistant by one of the professors who graded my Honours research. Under her guidance, I learnt a lot more about statistical analysis and was involved in a number of research projects, where my responsibilities included collecting the data, cleaning the data, analysing the date, and helping with the write up of research publications. As a result of this, I developed a knack for data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and regression analysis. My proudest achievement was when my data analytical skills helped conceptualise a piece of research that led to the presentation of the research at an Academy of Management symposium. Since leaving my role in research, my economics knowledge, data analytics and evidence based decision making skills have been applied practically in the various roles I‚Äôve undertaken.\nI‚Äôm a naturally curious thinker with an infectious smile üòÉ and a knack for getting things done. I might seem a little shy at first, but once we click, I won‚Äôt stop talking! Loyalty and responsibility are everything to me, especially when it comes to family and friends. As an INTP (Logician), I love exploring unconventional ideas, solving puzzles, and questioning the world around me. My ADHD-wired brain makes me a hands-on learner who thrives on creativity and innovation. I don‚Äôt just accept ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been‚Äù‚ÄîI‚Äôm all about finding better, smarter ways to do things!\n\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è What I‚Äôm passionate about\n\nEvidence based decision making\nWelfare and Social Economics\nCommunity services\nTechnology\n\n\n\n\nMy unique skills\n\nI‚Äôve got a ultra special ability to solve problems in the most unique ways. If you want a problem solved, just tell me the expected outcome, give me the resources, what is the time limit and don‚Äôt ask how I do it. It will magically get dealt with.\nI‚Äôm able to learn systems and procedures extremely fast just from observation and trying it myself.\nI have the ability to be rather accurate at interpreting body language.\nI‚Äôm able to identify big picture patterns and trends.\n\n\n\n\nTraining & Qualifications\n\nBachelor of Economics (Honours)\nDiploma of Community Services\nDiploma of Counselling\nCertificate IV Government (Investigations)\nCertificate IV Government (Statutory Compliance)\nCertificate III in Investigative Services\n\n\n\n\nMy technical skills\n\nR\nSPSS\nBash\nHTML & CSS\nComputing systems\nNetworking\nTechnical support\n\n\n\n\n‚úã My community services\nGiving back to the community is something I really value.\n\n\nJustice of the Peace (resigned)\n\nA voluntary position to provide a service to the community by performing the duties the law imposes on JPs and to assist in the administration of justice and in the maintenance of peace, order and good government.

I then specified to read only the sheet ‚ÄúBITRE_Fatal_Crash_Count_By_Date‚Äù and to skip the first 2 rows. The headings start from the third row of the dataframe.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash &lt;- read_xlsx(\n  \"~/Documents/R Studio/Australian Fatal Road Accidents/bitre_fatal_crashes_dec2024.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"BITRE_Fatal_Crash_Count_By_Date\",\n  skip = 2\n)\n\n\n\n\nChecking the dataset\nI checked the variables for their structures and summary statistics (seen below) to get an initial idea of the data. Significant things noted were:\n\nThe variables ‚ÄúMonth‚Äù and ‚ÄúDay Of Week‚Äù are characters. It would be good to change them into factors to create levels.\nThe number of total crashes would be my main interest here, however the way it is now did not make much sense.

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nFindings\nThere seemed to be some trend when the number of fatal crashes is grouped into the different times, e.g.¬†year, month, day. It was found that when the data was grouped according to:\n\nYears: There is a decrease in the number of fatal crashes from 1989 to about 2018 or 2019, before trending up again, which supports my anecdotal observations.\nMonths: December was the month with the highest number of fatal crashes and February was the month with the lowest fatal crashes.\nSeasons: Do not seem to have much of an effect when the data is grouped into the seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter).\nDays of the week: There is an observable difference, whereby Saturday has the highest number of fatal crashes and both Monday and Tuesday had the least number of fatal crashes.\n\nThe sections below will lay out in more depth about how my one hypothesis turned into several questions.\n\nCan we see anything when looking at the BIG picture?\nLooking at the big picture, it appears the number of fatal crashes contradicts my hypothesis that there is an increase in fatal crashes (using what I call eyeball analysis)- it looked like it was trending down.\nI needed to look at the total number of crashes per year specifically to confirm this.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nggplot(crash_mutate, aes(x = Month, y = `Number of fatal crashes`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Year) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Yearly comparison of fatal crashes in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it true that the number of crashes over time, from 1989-2024, is actually going down and not going up as hypothesised?\nYes and no. The trend line on the graphs below shows the total number of fatal crashes per year trending downwards from 1989 to around about 2018 or 2019, before going back up again. Of course, to confirm this empirically, I will need to statistically identify the minimum point of the trend using regression analysis (either Polynomial or Time Series regression.\nOur summary statistics below, after the graph, confirms this. The maximum total number of fatal crashes is 2407 crashes during 1989, and the minimum total number of fatal crashes is 998 crashes during the year of 2020.\nSo I was right (to a certain extend), there is a slight upward trend (only in the last few years) in the number of fatal car crashes.\nThis led me to wonder- what other patterns or trends can be observed from this simple set of data. Is there a particular month or day which has more fatal crashes or less fatal crashes? Would the months where there are large movements of people, such as Christmas, have more fatal crashes or times like winter (that is between June to August here in Australia)? Or particular days such as weekdays when there are more people rushing about their daily lives compared to the weekend.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_year &lt;- crash_mutate %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(`Number of fatal crashes`))\n\nggplot(crash_year, aes(x = Year, y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Anuual comparison of fatal crashes in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nsummary(crash_year)\n\n\n      Year          Total     \n Min.   :1989   Min.   : 998  \n 1st Qu.:1998   1st Qu.:1144  \n Median :2006   Median :1444  \n Mean   :2006   Mean   :1425  \n 3rd Qu.:2015   3rd Qu.:1608  \n Max.   :2024   Max.   :2407  \n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_year %&gt;% summarise(\n  year_max = Year[which.max(Total)],\n  crash_max = max(Total),\n  year_min = Year[which.min(Total)],\n  crash_min = min(Total)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 4\n  year_max crash_max year_min crash_min\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1989      2407     2020       998\n\n\n\n\nWhat monthly patterns or trends does the data tell us?\nIt seemed that I was right. Looking at the first graph below, December is the month with 4601 fatal crashes since 1989, as compared to February which had the least number of fatal crashes with a total of 3899 fatal crashes. This coincides with what is generally known that December is the start of school holidays and annual leave in preparation for the summer break and Christmas and New Year festivities. This is the time of mass movements outwards from the cities towards the regional areas. February on the other hand, is the end of this period. Children all head back to school and the holy trinity of public holidays in Australia- Christmas, New Years and Australia Day, has ended and everyone have to head back to the office to save up money to start it all again.\nThe first graph looked a bit messy and thus the data is re-arranged to descending order in the second graph. I am unable to see any other patterns or trends here. If you do, please let me know.\nAs mentioned above, what about seasons? Would winter have more fatal crashes?\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_month &lt;- crash_mutate %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(`Number of fatal crashes`)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Month)\n\nggplot(crash_month, aes(x = Month, y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Total), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fatal crashes per month in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nggplot(crash_month, aes(x = reorder(Month, -Total), y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Total), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fatal crashes per month in Australia (descending), 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nsummary(crash_month)\n\n\n     Month       Total     \n Jan    :1   Min.   :3899  \n Feb    :1   1st Qu.:4150  \n Mar    :1   Median :4242  \n Apr    :1   Mean   :4274  \n May    :1   3rd Qu.:4368  \n Jun    :1   Max.   :4601  \n (Other):6                 \n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_month %&gt;% summarise(\n  month_max = Month[which.max(Total)],\n  crash_max = max(Total),\n  month_min = Month[which.min(Total)],\n  crash_min = min(Total)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 4\n  month_max crash_max month_min crash_min\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Dec            4601 Feb            3899\n\n\n\n\nWould there be a seasonal effect on the number of fatal crashes?\nContrary what I thought, there did not seem to have any trends or patterns in the number of fatal crashes when the data is grouped into seasons.

The graph below shows that there was quite a large difference between Saturday and Monday.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThere appears to be some trends relating to fatal car crashes in Australian between 1989 to 2024 when the data is grouped by time. This EDA was conducted due to my observations that there seems to be more fatal car crashes over the last few years. This anecdotal observation underpinned my hypothesis that there is an increasing trend in fatal crashes in Australia. Using EDA and summary statistics, the hypothesis was right, in the sense that there was a decline in fatal car crashes over the years from 1989 to around 2018/ 2019 before trending up again over the last few years.\nThis led me to further wonder what other trends was captured by the data if the time was grouped into months, seasons and days of the week. Again there was an observable trend in the number of fatal car crashes in months (highest in December and lowest in February) and days (highest on Saturdays and lowest on Mondays & Tuesdays). The seasons did appear to have much of an effect on the number of fatal car crashes.\nThis was a simple analysis for me to get back into data analysis and to learn R. More can be done by:\n\nConducting time series analysis to identify specific trends of fatal crashes over the years,\nConduct in depth analysis consisting of more variables using the sheet in the dataset that consists of a more detail breakdown of variables collected such as location, crash type, vehicle details,\nUndertake correlation and regression analysis of the above."

I then specified to read only the sheet ‚ÄúBITRE_Fatal_Crash_Count_By_Date‚Äù and to skip the first 2 rows. The headings start from the third row of the dataframe.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash &lt;- read_xlsx(\n  \"~/Documents/R Studio/Australian Fatal Road Accidents/bitre_fatal_crashes_dec2024.xlsx\",\n  sheet = \"BITRE_Fatal_Crash_Count_By_Date\",\n  skip = 2\n)\n\n\n\n\nChecking the dataset\nI checked the variables for their structures and summary statistics (seen below) to get an initial idea of the data. Significant things noted were:\n\nThe variables ‚ÄúMonth‚Äù and ‚ÄúDay Of Week‚Äù are characters. It would be good to change them into factors to create levels.\nThe number of total crashes would be my main interest here, however the way it is now did not make much sense. It needed to be aggregated as time is grouped together (Year, Month and Day).\nI would usually check for missing values.

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nFindings\nThere seemed to be some trend when the number of fatal crashes is grouped into the different times, e.g.¬†year, month, day. It was found that when the data was grouped according to:\n\nYears: There is a decrease in the number of fatal crashes from 1989 to about 2018 or 2019, before trending up again, which supports my anecdotal observations.\nMonths: December was the month with the highest number of fatal crashes and February was the month with the lowest fatal crashes.\nSeasons: Do not seem to have much of an effect when the data is grouped into the seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter).\nDays of the week: There is an observable difference, whereby Saturday has the highest number of fatal crashes and both Monday and Tuesday had the least number of fatal crashes.\n\nThe sections below will lay out in more depth about how my one hypothesis turned into several questions.\n\nCan we see anything when looking at the BIG picture?\nLooking at the big picture, it appears the number of fatal crashes contradicts my hypothesis that there is an increase in fatal crashes (using what I call eyeball analysis)- it looked like it was trending down.\nI needed to look at the total number of crashes per year specifically to confirm this.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nggplot(crash_mutate, aes(x = Month, y = `Number of fatal crashes`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Year) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Yearly comparison of fatal crashes in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it true that the number of crashes over time, from 1989-2024, is actually going down and not going up as hypothesised?\nYes and no. The trend line on the graphs below shows the total number of fatal crashes per year trending downwards from 1989 to around about 2018 or 2019, before going back up again. Of course, to confirm this empirically, I will need to statistically identify the minimum point of the trend using regression analysis (either Polynomial or Time Series regression.\nOur summary statistics below, after the graph, confirms this. The maximum total number of fatal crashes is 2407 crashes during 1989, and the minimum total number of fatal crashes is 998 crashes during the year of 2020.\nSo I was right (to a certain extend), there is a slight upward trend (only in the last few years) in the number of fatal car crashes.\nThis led me to wonder- what other patterns or trends can be observed from this simple set of data. Is there a particular month or day which has more fatal crashes or less fatal crashes? Would the months where there are large movements of people, such as Christmas, have more fatal crashes or times like winter (that is between June to August here in Australia)? Or particular days such as weekdays when there are more people rushing about their daily lives compared to the weekend.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_year &lt;- crash_mutate %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(`Number of fatal crashes`))\n\nggplot(crash_year, aes(x = Year, y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Anuual comparison of fatal crashes in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nsummary(crash_year)\n\n\n      Year          Total     \n Min.   :1989   Min.   : 998  \n 1st Qu.:1998   1st Qu.:1144  \n Median :2006   Median :1444  \n Mean   :2006   Mean   :1425  \n 3rd Qu.:2015   3rd Qu.:1608  \n Max.   :2024   Max.   :2407  \n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_year %&gt;% summarise(\n  year_max = Year[which.max(Total)],\n  crash_max = max(Total),\n  year_min = Year[which.min(Total)],\n  crash_min = min(Total)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 4\n  year_max crash_max year_min crash_min\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1989      2407     2020       998\n\n\n\n\nWhat monthly patterns or trends does the data tell us?\nIt seemed that I was right. Looking at the first graph below, December is the month with 4601 fatal crashes since 1989, as compared to February which had the least number of fatal crashes with a total of 3899 fatal crashes. This coincides with what is generally known that December is the start of school holidays and annual leave in preparation for the summer break and Christmas and New Year festivities. This is the time of mass movements outwards from the cities towards the regional areas. February on the other hand, is the end of this period. Children all head back to school and the holy trinity of public holidays in Australia- Christmas, New Years and Australia Day, has ended and everyone have to head back to the office to save up money to start it all again.\nThe first graph looked a bit messy and thus the data is re-arranged to descending order in the second graph. I am unable to see any other patterns or trends here. If you do, please let me know.\nAs mentioned above, what about seasons? Would winter have more fatal crashes?\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_month &lt;- crash_mutate %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(`Number of fatal crashes`)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Month)\n\nggplot(crash_month, aes(x = Month, y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Total), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fatal crashes per month in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nggplot(crash_month, aes(x = reorder(Month, -Total), y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Total), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fatal crashes per month in Australia (descending), 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nsummary(crash_month)\n\n\n     Month       Total     \n Jan    :1   Min.   :3899  \n Feb    :1   1st Qu.:4150  \n Mar    :1   Median :4242  \n Apr    :1   Mean   :4274  \n May    :1   3rd Qu.:4368  \n Jun    :1   Max.   :4601  \n (Other):6                 \n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_month %&gt;% summarise(\n  month_max = Month[which.max(Total)],\n  crash_max = max(Total),\n  month_min = Month[which.min(Total)],\n  crash_min = min(Total)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 4\n  month_max crash_max month_min crash_min\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Dec            4601 Feb            3899\n\n\n\n\nWould there be a seasonal effect on the number of fatal crashes?\nContrary what I thought, there did not seem to have any trends or patterns in the number of fatal crashes when the data is grouped into seasons. While I thought that perhaps there would be more fatal crashes in winter (wet roads &gt; more crashes &gt; more deaths), the number of fatal crashes was the second lowest with 12637 fatal crashes among the four seasons.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_seasons &lt;- crash_month %&gt;%\n  mutate(Season = case_when(\n    Month %in% c('Dec', 'Jan', 'Feb') ~ 'Summer',\n    Month %in% c('Mar', 'Apr', 'May') ~ 'Autumn',\n    Month %in% c('Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug') ~ 'Winter',\n    Month %in% c('Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov') ~ 'Spring'),\n  Season = factor(Season, levels = c(\"Summer\", \"Autumn\", \"Winter\", \"Spring\"))) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Season) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(Total)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Season)\n    \nggplot(crash_seasons, aes(x = Season, y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Total), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fatal crashes grouped by seasons in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich day of the week has the most fatal car crashes and which day had the least?\nSaturday had the most number of fatal crashes and Monday (followed closely by Tuesday) had the least number of fatal crashes. The graph below shows that there was quite a large difference between Saturday and Monday. I would not go to the extend of saying the result is significant yet as it has not been tested for statistical significance. On face value though, it seems quite significant compared to the result when the data is grouped by seasons.\n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_day &lt;- crash %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Day Of Week`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(`Number of fatal crashes`)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Day Of Week` = factor(`Day Of Week`, levels = c(\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\")))\n\nggplot(crash_day, aes(x = `Day Of Week`, y = Total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fatal crashes grouped by days in Australia, 1989-2024\",\n    x = \"Day of the week\",\n    y = \"Total Number of fatal crashes\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE)\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Total), vjust = -0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the code here\nsummary(crash_day)\n\n\n    Day Of Week     Total     \n Monday   :1    Min.   :5996  \n Tuesday  :1    1st Qu.:6290  \n Wednesday:1    Median :7013  \n Thursday :1    Mean   :7326  \n Friday   :1    3rd Qu.:8228  \n Saturday :1    Max.   :9237  \n Sunday   :1                  \n\n\nCheck out the code here\ncrash_day %&gt;% summarise(\n  day_max = `Day Of Week`[which.max(Total)],\n  crash_max = max(Total),\n  day_min = `Day Of Week`[which.min(Total)],\n  crash_min = min(Total)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 4\n  day_max  crash_max day_min crash_min\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Saturday      9237 Monday       5996\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\nThe purpose of this exploratory analysis is to understand the data and to generate questions and hypotheses.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThere appears to be some trends relating to fatal car crashes in Australian between 1989 to 2024 when the data is grouped by time. This EDA was conducted due to my observations that there seems to be more fatal car crashes over the last few years. This anecdotal observation underpinned my hypothesis that there is an increasing trend in fatal crashes in Australia. Using EDA and summary statistics, the hypothesis was right, in the sense that there was a decline in fatal car crashes over the years from 1989 to around 2018/ 2019 before trending up again over the last few years.\nThis led me to further wonder what other trends was captured by the data if the time was grouped into months, seasons and days of the week. Again there was an observable trend in the number of fatal car crashes in months (highest in December and lowest in February) and days (highest on Saturdays and lowest on Mondays & Tuesdays). The seasons did appear to have much of an effect on the number of fatal car crashes.\nThis was a simple analysis for me to get back into data analysis and to learn R. More can be done by:\n\nConducting time series analysis to identify specific trends of fatal crashes over the years,\nConduct in depth analysis consisting of more variables using the sheet in the dataset that consists of a more detail breakdown of variables collected such as location, crash type, vehicle details,\nUndertake correlation and regression analysis of the above."

    "text": "I believe that data can help take us a long way in making better decisions. I‚Äôm passionate about evidence-based decision making and the practical use of it. My areas of interest lie in the practical application of Welfare and Social Economics- the study of the relationship between resource allocation in society and social well-being.\nMy journey with data first started when I studied Economics at University. I later graduated with a Bachelor of Economics (Honours), with majors in Economics, Management and Human Resource Management. My honours journey introduced the art and science of data analytics with my own research project. I found that I excelled in quantitative research and analysis. During that year, I also achieved top grades in HR Analytics, which pulled on a number of Economics concepts at the organisational level.\nAs a result of my Honours research, I was hired as a research assistant by one of the professors who graded my Honours research. Under her guidance, I learnt a lot more about statistical analysis and was involved in a number of research projects, where my responsibilities included collecting the data, cleaning the data, analysing the date, and helping with the write up of research publications. As a result of this, I developed a knack for data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and regression analysis. My proudest achievement was when my data analytical skills helped conceptualise a piece of research that led to the presentation of the research at an Academy of Management symposium. Since leaving my role in research, my economics knowledge, data analytics and evidence based decision making skills have been applied practically in the various roles I‚Äôve undertaken.\nI‚Äôm a naturally curious thinker with an infectious smile üòÉ and a knack for getting things done.

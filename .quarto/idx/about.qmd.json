I'm passionate about evidence-based decision making and the practical use of it. My areas of interest lie in the practical application of Welfare and Social Economics- the study of the relationship between resource allocation in society and social well-being.\n\nMy journey with data first started when I studied Economics at University. I later graduated with a Bachelor of Economics (Honours), with majors in Economics, Management and Human Resource Management. My honours journey introduced the art and science of data analytics with my own research project. I found that I excelled in quantitative research and analysis. During that year, I also achieved top grades in HR Analytics, which pulled on a number of Economics concepts at the organisational level.\n\nAs a result of my Honours research, I was hired as a research assistant by one of the professors who graded my Honours research. Under her guidance, I learnt a lot more about statistical analysis and was involved in a number of research projects, where my responsibilities included collecting the data, cleaning the data, analysing the date, and helping with the write up of research publications. As a result of this, I developed a knack for data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and regression analysis. My proudest achievement was when my data analytical skills helped conceptualise a piece of research that led to the presentation of the research at an [Academy of Management symposium](#publication). Since leaving my role in research, my economics knowledge, data analytics and evidence based decision making skills have been applied practically in the various roles I've undertaken.\n\nI‚Äôm a naturally curious thinker with an infectious smile üòÉ and a knack for getting things done. I might seem a little shy at first, but once we click, I won‚Äôt stop talking! Loyalty and responsibility are everything to me, especially when it comes to family and friends. As an INTP (Logician), I love exploring unconventional ideas, solving puzzles, and questioning the world around me.

Hi! I'm Eugene ðŸ‘‹

I believe that data can help take us a long way in making better decisions. I'm passionate about evidence-based decision making and the practical use of it. My areas of interest lie in the practical application of Welfare Economics- the study of the relationship between resource allocation in society and social well-being.

The aim of this site is to harness the power of open source information and to bring together key resources and ideas to help better our communities and society that we live in. I want to make a better world for my children, their friends and for generations to come. I want to bring to light evidence-based issues, different perspectives or better ways to do things, with the hope that someone out there, whether in consulting, a policy maker, or some one with the power to do something, can do something.

The key features of this site include:

-   [Publicy available databases relating to Social Work, Community Services & Social Policy](/database)
-   [My own data analysis and publications from publicly available databases](/posts)

I welcome any feedback and any ideas on what else can be done to make this a more useful resource.
